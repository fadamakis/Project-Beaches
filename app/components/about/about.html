        <p class="col-lg-5">Oh Hello there! I'm so glad you made it so far. Let me introduce myself. My name is Fotis Adamakis and I have worked in more than 20 projects in the last 4 years as a Front end developer. The biggest and most chalenging of them was <a href="https://netrobe.com/" target="_blank">Netrobe</a>. A fashion social network built with backbone.js , fabric.js and Django CMS. Of course it's responsive.
        Other than that I have worked with most of the popular PHP frameworks including Laravel, Zend, Symfony and Wordpress.
        I'm a big Scrum aficionado having worked with it and trying to spread the love in every opportunity.
        <br><br>
        That's me. Head to my <a target="_blank" href="https://gr.linkedin.com/in/fadamakis">Linkedin</a> for more or contact me at <a href="mailto:fadamakis@gmail.com">fadamakis@gmail.com</a>
